# Data Storage & Machine Learning Analysis of Football Play Gestures

This project supported a fictional collaboration between entrepreneurial theater owner, Rudy, and Fighting Irish Pictures, a made-up movie studio, to create an interactive football experience in movie theater lobbies across the country. Designed to promote the fictional film Rudy: Heart of a Champion, the exhibit invited moviegoers to step into the action by “calling plays” with gestures performed on their smartphones.

In each interactive scene, participants stood within 30 feet of a life-sized screen and performed one of three football play signals using the Signal Caller web app:

* Collapse Left (<)

* Irish Surge (N)

* Touchdown Halo (O, Circle x 2)

The app recorded gyroscope and accelerometer data from the smartphone, along with user metadata (such as name and age), to capture how each play signal was performed.

The goal was to:

* Capture and store raw motion data from users.

* Train a machine learning model to classify the play signals based on engineered features of the sensor data.

Ultimately, this fictional use case blended sports, cinema, and machine learning to demonstrate how sensor data and intelligent systems could drive immersive entertainment experiences.
